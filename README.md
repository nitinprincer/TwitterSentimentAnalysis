# TwitterSentimentAnalysis

* [IEEE Research Paper](https://github.com/nitinprincer/TwitterSentimentAnalysis/blob/master/VOICE%20RECOGNITION%20AND%20TWITTER%20SENTIMENT%20ANALYSIS-%20IEEE%20Research%20Paper.pdf).

* After tweets extractions, we noticed that language is given in abbreviation. It is difficult to understand few uncommon ones. So, we developed a new [document](https://github.com/nitinprincer/TwitterSentimentAnalysis/blob/master/dictionary%20of%20language.csv) which has full form of all the languages registered in the world.
